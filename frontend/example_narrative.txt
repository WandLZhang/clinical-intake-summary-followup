It's been a pretty typical week for me, health-wise. No major complaints, really. I haven't noticed being any more thirsty or needing to pee more often than usual. My weight's been stable, and I haven't had any vision changes or slow-healing sores. I do get tired in the afternoons, but I think that's just part of getting older! Maybe a bit more tired than usual this week, now that I think about it. But no tingling in my hands or feet, and no infections to speak of.

I check my blood sugar every morning before breakfast. It usually falls somewhere between 90 and 110 mg/dL. I don't always check after meals, but when I do, it's typically under 140 mg/dL. I'm taking metformin, 500mg twice a day. I'm pretty good about taking it as prescribed - I keep it next to my toothbrush so I remember it morning and night. No problems with the medication itself, thankfully.

I'd say my diet is...somewhat healthy. I try to cook at home most nights, and I include vegetables with dinner. I have a bit of a sweet tooth, though, so I definitely indulge in dessert more often than I should. Fruits and veggies? Probably a few times a week, on average.

I'm not a gym rat by any means, but I do try to stay active. I take my dog for a walk most days, and I like to go for hikes on the weekends when the weather is nice. So, a few times a week for sure.

My stress levels are generally pretty moderate. Work can get hectic sometimes, but I have good coping mechanisms. I haven't felt particularly down or depressed lately, and my sleep has been fine. No changes in appetite or anything like that.

I haven't noticed any changes in my memory or thinking skills. Sometimes I forget where I put my keys, but I think that's pretty normal!

Besides diabetes, I have high cholesterol, but it's well-managed with medication. I see Dr. Jones for my diabetes care, and I have a check-up with her every six months. No major concerns at the moment, but I do wonder if there's anything more I could be doing to prevent complications down the road.
